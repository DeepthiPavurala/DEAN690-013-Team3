# Virginia Climate Indicators

The Virginia Climate Data Dashboard aims to bridge the information gap faced by municipal planners in the state. By providing a centralized platform for accessing and analyzing historical and projected climate data, the dashboard empowers planners to make informed decisions regarding climate adaptation and mitigation.

The dashboard leverages advanced data visualization techniques to present climate indicators, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, in a clear and actionable manner. This enables planners to identify climate risks, assess vulnerabilities, and develop effective strategies to protect their communities from the impacts of climate change.
